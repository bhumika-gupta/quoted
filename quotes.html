Rowling</em></li><li>One can never have enough socks," said Dumbledore. "Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>There is no good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign… to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very own skin. Quirrel, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley...He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter - the boy who lived! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all - the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them. – <em>J.K.

"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves-""Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea.""Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the other twin. "Once-""Or twice-""A minute-""All summer-""Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,Teach us something please,Whether we be old and bald,Or young with scabby knees,Our heads could do with fillingWith some interesting stuff,For now they're bare and full of air,Dead flies and bits of fluff,So teach us something worth knowing,Bring us back what we've forgot,Just do your best, we'll do the rest,And learn until our brains all rot... – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even put a stopper on death. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Fred, you next," the plump woman said. "I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can't you tell I'm George?" "Sorry, George, dear." "Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy and off he went. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy—this boy!—knows nothin' abou'—about ANYTHING?"Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad."I know some things," he said. "I can, you know, do math and stuff. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry -- yer a wizard. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. – <em>J.K.

"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. "All right- PLEASE." "NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha!

The wand chooses the wizard, remember...I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?" Harry shook his head."Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help." Harry thought. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want... whatever we want..." "Yes and no," said Dumbledore quietly. "It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible."The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. "Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. "Make Harry get it.""Get the mail, Harry.""Make Dudley get it.""Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley. – <em>J. K. Rowling</em></li><li>No, thanks," said Harry. "The toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it— it might be sick." Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Longbottom, if brains were gold, you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.“Er — all right.”He cleared his throat.“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just like Harry's did.Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection."Mum?" he whispered. "Dad?"They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside of him, half joy, half terrible sadness. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.”	“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”	“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Always the innocent are the first victims, so it has been for ages past, so it is now. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.'So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —''Jordan!' growled Professor McGonagall.'I mean after that open and revolting foul —''Jordan, I'm warning you —''All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. "It was flying."Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!"Dudley and Piers sniggered."I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It's leviOsa, not levioSA! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" yelled Uncle Vernon. But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head. ‘NEVER –’ he thundered, ‘– INSULT – ALBUS – DUMBLEDORE – IN – FRONT – OF – ME! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls.We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.George!Only joking, Mum. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting up in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: 'To Harry Potter - the boy who lived! – <em>J K Rowling</em></li><li>Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching towards the dungeon ceiling.I don't know," said Harry quietly. "I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try asking her?" A few people laughed; Harry caught sight of Seamus's eye and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor house for your cheek, Potter. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I don't need a cloak to become invisible. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Tut, tut — fame clearly isn't everything. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. – <em>JK Rowling</em></li><li>There will be books written about Harry. Every child in the world will know his name. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>What she did have were Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You might belong in Gryffindor,Where dwell the brave at heart,Their daring, nerve, and chivalry,Set Gryffindors apart;You might belong in Hufflepuff,Where they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,And unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,If you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning,Will always find their kind;Or perhaps in Slytherin,You'll make your real friends,These cunning folks use any meansTo achieve their ends. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Professor Dumbledore. Can I ask you something?" "Obviously, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You may ask me one more thing, however." "What do you see when you look in the mirror?" "I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks." Harry stared."One can never have enough socks," said Dumbledore. "Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books."It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>That's chess!" snapped Ron. "You've got to make some sacrifices! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>A bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. "You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor - you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once." Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. "Bleaaargh - see? Sprouts. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was going to be sick-he hit the field on all fours-coughed-and something gold fell into his hand.'I've got the snitch!' he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.'He didn't catch it, he nearly swalloed it,' Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference-Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results-Gryffindor had won by 170 points to 60. – <em>J. K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?”He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth.“Alas! Ear wax! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Fifty?” Harry gasped.“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily.“Professor — please —”“You can’t —”“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?”Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid. You live in a wooden house! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”“Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?""Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of were thickset and looked like bodyguards."Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," said the pale boy carelssly, noticing where Harry was looking. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy." Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford."He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it. “I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall without getting lost once. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You think it - wise - to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?""I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Oh,you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your tops hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. Y ou might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell brave of heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet wise old Ravenclaw, If you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achive their ends. So put me on! Don't be afraid! And you won't get in a flap! You're safe in my hands(though I have none) For I'm a Thinking Cap!! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:Mr. H. PotterThe Cupboard under the Stairs4 Privet DriveLittle WhingingSurrey – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. You don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”“— unless they crack my head open.”“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp —''So light a fire!' Harry choked.'Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!' Hermoine cried, wringing her hands.'HAVE YOU GONE MAD?' Ron bellowed. 'ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, "What's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?""Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I knew it! I knew it! ”“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!”This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.“The what?” said Harry and Ron.“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look — read that, there. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there."Welcome!" he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!""Thank you!"He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly."Mad?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Play Quidditch at all?”“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?”“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings...Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public high school. Dudley thought this was very funny. "They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall," he told Harry. "Want to come upstairs and practice?" "No, thanks," said Harry. "The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it - it might be sick." Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I'm a what?" gasped Harry."A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform...As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that if was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>No es bueno dejarse arrastrar por los sueños y olvidarse de vivir, recuérdalo. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water."What's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia."Your new school uniform," she said. Harry looked in the bowl again."Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves it's own mark. To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. – <em>J.K.Rowling</em></li><li>I'm serious, Harry, don't go." But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>After all, to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who is gone at last! Even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy, happy day. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>How did you get here?" Harry asked."Flew," said Hagrid."Flew? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You know how I think they choose people for Gryffindor team?" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for now reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money - you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>STUDENTS OUT OF BED! STUDENTS OUT OF BED IN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Never," said Hagrid irritably, "try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?”“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.“Never mind,” said Harry quickly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Are you sure that’s a real spell?’ said the girl. ‘Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all. It was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard – I’ve learnt all our set books off by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough – I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?’She said all this very fast.Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.‘I’m Ron Weasley,’ Ron muttered.‘Harry Potter,’ said Harry.‘Are you really?’ said Hermione. ‘I know all about you, of course – I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.’‘Am I?’ said Harry, feeling dazed.‘Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,’ said Hermione. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I've decided to call him Norbert,' said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. 'He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mummy?''He's lost his marbles,' Ron muttered in Harry's ear.'Hagrid,' said Harry loudly, 'give it a fortnight and Norbert's going to be as big as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.Hagrid bit his lip.'I- I know I can't jus' dump him, I can't.'Harry suddenly turned to Ron.'Charlie,' he said.'You're losing it too,' said Ron. 'I'm Ron, remember? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>She was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”“Light?” said Ron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>But Snape always seemed to hate me so much. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own? Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you.”Hermione left. Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The narrow path had opened up suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Okay, men,” he said. “And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson. “And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.” “The big one,” said Fred Weasley. “The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George. “We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on the team last year.” “Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.” He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.” “Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and scratched his beard. 'Shouldn'ta lost me temper,' he said ruefully, 'but it didn't work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do. – <em>J.K.Rowling</em></li><li>La vigilia di Natale, Harry andò a letto pregustando le leccornie e i divertimenti dell'indomani, ma senza aspettarsi nessun regalo. Ma al suo risveglio, il mattino seguente di buon'ora, la prima cosa che vide ai piedi del suo letto fu un un mucchio di pacchetti."Buon natale" gli fece Ron ancora assonnato, mentre Harry si buttava giù dal letto e si infilava la vestaglia."Anche a te" gli rispose "Ma... Hai visto che roba? Ho ricevuto dei regali!""E che cosa ti aspettavi, un mazzo di rape?" disse Ron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this paper. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hay muchos tipos de valentía -dijo sonriendo Dumbledore-. Hay que tener un gran coraje para oponerse a nuestros enemigos, pero hace falta el mismo valor para hacerlo con los amigos. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Now if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed - or worse, expelled. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hay que tener un gran valor para enfrentarse a nuestros enemigos, pero se necesita aún más valor para enfrentarse a nuestros amigos. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>My brain surprises even me sometimes. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Professor Severus Snape: There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few... [stares at Draco Malfoy] Professor Severus Snape: Who possess, the predisposition... I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. [notices Harry scribbling on his paper] Professor Severus Snape: Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention! [steps over to Harry] Professor Severus Snape: Mister Potter. Our new celebrity. – <em>J.K.Rowling</em></li><li>Harry -- yer a wizard.I'm a what? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous—a legend—I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future—there will be books written about Harry—every child in our world will know his name! ... – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?”“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry. “What?” said Harry. “Harry Potter,” chorused the twins. “Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh", said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a wizard. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter . . . what an honor. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>To Harry Potter — the boy who lived! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry―yer a wizard. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Stop, stop, stop, you're going to poke someone's eye out! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious . . .”“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”Harry swallowed. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, it had been a quite personal question. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Pilihan kitalah Harry yang menunjukkan orang seperti apa sebenarnya kita, lebih dari kemampuan kita... – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>La verdad -Dumbledore suspiró- es una cosa terrible y hermosa, y por lo tanto debe ser tratada con gran cuidado. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>El problema es que los humanos tienen el don de elegir precisamente las cosas que son peores para ellos. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Well — I was lucky once, wasn't I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>¡Yo! -exclamó Hermione-. ¡Libros! ¡Inteligencia! Hay cosas mucho más importantes, amistad, y valentía y... ¡Oh, Harry, ten cuidado! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Bisogna chiamare le cose con il loro nome, la paura del nome non fa altro che aumentare la paura della cosa stessa. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters... – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Essere stati amati tanto profondamente ci protegge per sempre, anche quando la persona che ci ha amato non c’è più. È una cosa che ci resta dentro, nella pelle. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He'll have that scar forever.""Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?""Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. – <em>J. K. Rowling</em></li><li>Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Haber sido amado tan profundamente, aunque esa persona que nos amó no esté, nos deja para siempre una protección. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed – or worse, expelled. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>SO WHAT" Harry shouted. "Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? Do you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>That thing has a name? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Non serve a niente rifugiarsi nei sogni e dimenticarsi di vivere. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!” “Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The forest hides many secrets. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.” “Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. “Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Your great puddin' of a son don' need fattin' anymore Dursley, don't worry – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Orang yang paling bahagia di dunia adalah orang yang bisa menggunakan Cermin Tarsah seperti cermin biasa, yaitu, kalau dia memandang cermin itu dia hanya melihat dirinya seperti apa adanya. (Albus Dumbledore) – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He hurried to car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees—Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. – <em>J. K. Rowling</em></li><li>Después de todo, para una mente bien organizada, la muerte no es más que la siguiente gran aventura. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Utiliza el nombre correcto para las cosas. El miedo a un nombre aumenta el miedo a la cosa que se nombra. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>So – that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?’ ‘What’s basketball?’ said Wood curiously. ‘Never mind,’ said Harry quickly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed – or worse, expelled. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ron: [mimicking Hermione] "It's Levi-OOOOH-sa not LevioSAR." She's a nightmare, honestly. It's no wonder she hasn't got any friends! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I’ll show them... it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Para una muerte bien organizada, la muerte no es más que la siguiente gran aventura. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection."Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?"They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You see, only one who wanted to find the stone - find it, but not use it - would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again. 'Just yer wand left -- oh yeah, an I still haven't got yeh a birthday present.' Harry felt himself go red. 'You don't have to --' 'I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The wand chooses the wizard. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Lo que sucedió en las mazmorras entre tu y el profesor Quirrell es completamente secreto, así que, naturalmente, todo el colegio lo sabe. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,’ said the giant. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons or phoenixes are quite the same. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Is that where—?’ whispered Professor McGonagall.‘Yes,’ said Dumbledore. ‘He'll have that scar for ever.’‘Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?’‘Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in useful. I have one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the London underground. Well—give him here, Hagrid—we'd better get this over with.’ Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the Dursleys’ house. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. “Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” “George!” “Only joking, Mum. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I always said he was off his rocker,’ said Ron, looking quite impressed at how mad his hero was. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Good evening," said Ronan. "Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?""Erm -""A bit," said Hermione timidly."A bit. Well, that's something." Ronan sighed. – <em>J. K.

My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. – <em>J.K.

Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and began to drink its blood. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him. “Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off. … Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” “The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You’re saying it wrong,’ Harry heard Hermione snap. ‘It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the “gar” nice and long.’‘You do it, then, if you’re so clever,’ Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand and said, ‘Wingardium Leviosa!’ Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, ‘SLYTHERIN!’ Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren’t many people left now. ‘Moon’ … ‘Nott’ … ‘Parkinson’ … then a pair of twin girls, ‘Patil’ and ‘Patil’ … then ‘Perks, Sally-Anne’ … and then, at last – ‘Potter, Harry!’ As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. ‘Potter, did she say?’ ‘The Harry Potter?’ The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the Hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. ‘Hmm,’ said a small voice in his ear. ‘Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes – and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting … So where shall I put you?’ Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, ‘Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.’ ‘Not Slytherin, eh?’ said the small voice. ‘Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that – no? Well, if you’re sure – better be GRYFFINDOR! – <em>J.K.

Does that help? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>What do you see when you look in the mirror?” “I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Harry stared. “One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Me está halagando-dijo con calma Dumbledore-.

Magic carpets all got punctures, have they? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>No thanks,’ said Harry. ‘The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it – it might be sick.’ Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said. – <em>J.K.

I told her you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo. – <em>J.K.

We might have ter put it out of its misery.” “And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger. “I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands … well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn’t know which was worse — people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. “That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Tía Petunia decía a menudo que Dudley parecía un angelito. Harry decía a menudo que Dudley parecía un cerdo con peluca. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.” “What?” “He saved his life.” “What?” “Yes . . .” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. . . . I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace. .  – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Sellotape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips. – <em>J.K.

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand and said, ‘Wingardium Leviosa!’ Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. ‘Oh, well done!’ cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. ‘Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!’ Ron was in a very bad temper by the end of the class. – <em>J.K.

The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget. – <em>J.K.

Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work."Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. "Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course. – <em>J.K.

It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something.” She stood up, glaring at them. “I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed or worse, expelled.

They were off. “And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too —” “JORDAN!” “Sorry, Professor.” The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. “And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc– no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goalposts, but he’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goalposts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDOR SCORE!” Gryffindor – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could – <em>J.K.

Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years. – <em>J.K.

I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs. – <em>J.K.

When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had – <em>J.K.

A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>«Svelti, su!» disse la madre, e i tre ragazzi si arrampicarono sul treno. Si sporsero dal finestrino per un ultimo bacio di addio e la sorellina più piccola si mise a piangere.«Non piangere, Ginny, ti manderemo stormi di gufi».«Ti manderemo una tavoletta del gabinetto da Hogwarts».«Ma George!»«Sto scherzando, ma’». – <em>J.K.

Ma neanche noi siamo stupidi... sappiamo benissimo che ci chiamiamo Gred e Forge!» – <em>J.K.

He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.

His blue eyes were light, bright and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice.

Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. “Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, – <em>J.K.

They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s – <em>J.K.

The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room. ‘The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. ‘The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.’ Her – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness Potion. – <em>J.K.

He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind … He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on.

Rowling</em></li><li>Good luck, Harry, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. – <em>J.K.

The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are – are – that they’re – dead. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>¡NUNCA ... INSULTE-A-ALBUS-DUMBLEDORE-EN-MI-PRESENCIA! – <em>J.K.

It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles which were floating in mid-air over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the Hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first-years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upwards and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, ‘It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside, I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.’ It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dear Harry, (it said, in a very untidy scrawl) I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig. Hagrid – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Es ist nicht gut, wenn wir nur unseren Träumen nachhängen und vergessen zu leben, glaub mir. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived."Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't news to them."Well- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?"Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets."Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses."Hermione left.Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron."Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go."They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else."We should have gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled."Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.""Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. "Mind you, we did save her.""She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her," Harry reminded him.They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady."Pig snout," they said and entered.The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates.But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned."Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom.""Oh, yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping."No Crabbe and Goyle here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called.The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy."Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching- he stretched out his hand- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.” “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!” Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. – <em>J.K.

Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-Curses (Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,’ said Dumbledore. ‘However, recent events must be taken into account. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He cleared his throat. “Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.’ She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. ‘Er – all right.’ He cleared his throat. ‘Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.’ He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed grey and fast asleep. ‘Are you sure that’s a real spell?’ said the girl. ‘Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard – I’ve learnt all our set books off by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough – I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?’ She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learnt all the set books off by heart either. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander cried, ‘Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... how curious ... how very curious ... – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He pushed the door ajar and peered inside – and a horrible scene met his eyes. Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mummy will never forget you! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hogwarts Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, insegnaci qualcosa per favore, a noi, anziani, calvi e tutti storti, a noi, ragazzi dai calzoni corti, le nostre teste devono riempirsi di cose interessanti da non dirsi, per ora sono vuote e piene d’aria, di mosche morte e roba secondaria, insegna a noi che cosa va imparato, ripeti ciò che abbiam dimenticato, fa’ del tuo meglio e noi faremo il resto, finché il cervello non ci andrà in dissesto. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>THE BOY WHO LIVED Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive. He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the ground and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” “Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign . . . to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.” Dumbledore now became – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere – I wonder, now – yes, why not – unusual combination – holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.’ Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Snape was trying to save me? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Esistono molti tipi di coraggio. Affrontare i nemici richiede notevole ardimento. Ma altrettanto ne occorre per affrontare gli amici. – <em>J.K.

Hermione ordered them. 'I know what this is - it's Devil's Snare!''Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,' snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant curling around his neck. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He’d really done something to be proud of now — no one could say he was just a famous name any more. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I’ve decided to call him Norbert,’ said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. ‘He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mummy? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Un no es pot nodrir de somnis i oblidar la vida. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. Flaming – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He’d never felt anything like that. It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goalposts — he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. Lee was still commentating. “Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no . . .” The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Why?” “Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.” “You’d like one?” “Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. “Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. “Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1.

They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived – <em>J.K.

He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. – <em>J.K.

A lui piaceva lamentarsi di tutto: i colleghi di lavoro, Harry, il consiglio, Harry, la banca, Harry, erano solo alcuni dei suoi argomenti preferiti. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,’ snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant curling around his neck. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Go on then, try and hit me!’ said Neville, raising his fists. ‘I’m ready! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t you call me an idiot!’ said Neville. ‘I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. ‘I won’t let you do it,’ he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. ‘I’ll – I’ll fight you! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?’ ‘Of course not,’ said Hermione briskly. ‘How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Good luck, Harry Potter,’ said Firenze. ‘The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I want Fang,’ said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth. ‘All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,’ said Hagrid. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I’m disgusted,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘Four students out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>And I gave Malfoy a black eye and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>she didn’t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe and Goyle. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Philosopher’s Stone? Harry didn’t see how he could – yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!’ said Ron. ‘He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.’ ‘There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,’ Neville choked. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t play,’ said Hermione at once. ‘Say you’re ill,’ said Ron. ‘Pretend to break your leg,’ Hermione suggested. ‘Really break your leg,’ said Ron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. ‘Mum?’ he whispered. ‘Dad? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You haven’t got a letter on yours,’ George observed. ‘I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid – we know we’re called Gred and Forge. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of home-made fudge. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early next morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Troll – in the dungeons – thought you ought to know. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You’re saying it wrong,’ Harry heard Hermione snap. ‘It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the “gar” nice and long.’ ‘You do it, then, if you’re so clever,’ Ron snarled. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers – I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?’ she snapped. ‘Didn’t you see what it was standing on?’ ‘The floor?’ Harry suggested. ‘I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.’ ‘No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learnt that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about and used it on you. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?’ ‘Throw it away and punch him on the nose,’ Ron suggested. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You’re a lot braver now you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,’ said Harry coolly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Then she suddenly smiled. ‘Your father would have been proud,’ she said. ‘He was an excellent Quidditch player himself. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It’s a Remembrall!’ he explained. ‘Gran knows I forget things – this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red – oh …’ His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, ‘… you’ve forgotten something … – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I don’t know,’ said Harry quietly. ‘I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death – if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ah, yes,’ he said softly, ‘Harry Potter. Our new – celebrity. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid. ‘Harry, Professor Quirrell will be – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,’ he said coolly. Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Er – yes, I think so,’ said Ron. ‘I think Mum’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.’ ‘George!’ ‘Only joking, Mum. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.’ ‘Great idea though, thanks, Mum. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I’m not Fred, I’m George,’ said the boy. ‘Honestly, woman, call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?’ ‘Sorry, George, dear.’ ‘Only joking, I am Fred, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter … After all, He Who Must Not Be Named did great things – terrible, yes, but great. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun – last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat-hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t be stupid,’ snapped Aunt Petunia. ‘I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things grey for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They stuff people’s heads down the toilet first day at Stonewall,’ he told Harry. ‘Want to come upstairs and practise?’ ‘No thanks,’ said Harry. ‘The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it – it might be sick.’ Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old jumper of Dudley’s (brown with orange bobbles). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a glove puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barber’s looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his fringe, which she left ‘to hide that horrible scar’. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel – Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: ‘To Harry Potter – the boy who lived! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He hurried to his car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. “Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. “Make Harry get it.” “Get the mail, Harry.” “Make – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>wherever I go,” said Quirrell – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings towards him hadn't changed one jot. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>No Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time - and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He is with me wherever I go' said Quirrell quietly. 'I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a counter-curse, trying to save you. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body but couldn't feel them - for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire - then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.There was already someone there - but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>But Harry - what if You-Know-Who's with him?''Well - I was lucky once, wasn't I?' said Harry, pointing at his scar.' I might get lucky again.'Hermione's lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.'Hermione!''Harry - you're a great wizard, you know.''I'm not as good as you', said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.'Me!' said Hermione. 'Books! And cleverness! There are more important things - friendship and bravery and - oh Harry - be careful! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>poking – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>pig’s – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes - her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green - exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just like Harry's did. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said 'Thanks', and hurried off to get plates.But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.'I'm a what?' gasped Harry.'A wizard, o' course', said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, 'an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.'Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>forgotten – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos . . . knew yeh didn’ have any . . . d’yeh like it?” Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. “Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking . . . Sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —” “Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills. Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, ‘Brazil, here I come … Thanksss, amigo. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>There are all kinds of courage, said Dumbledore, smiling. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends- Albus Dumbledore – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>House Championship. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>After all, to a well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>briskly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>(the sandwiches lay forgotten). – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.” Harry – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>DURSLEY!” he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>cleaning. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>written – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in grey water. ‘What’s this?’ he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. ‘Your new school uniform,’ she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. ‘Oh,’ he said. ‘I didn’t realise it had to be so wet. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>rummaging – <em>J.K.

Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hermione! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry’s – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>read – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>McGonagall, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>CHAPTER ONE — The Boy Who Lived Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>damn – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>doubted – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry — yer a wizard. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>owl – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>bewitched. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Scars can come in useful. I have one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the London Underground. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. Lee was still commentating. “Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no . . .” The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. “Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his broom . . . but he can’t have. . . .” Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>JESSICA, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>bye, and their younger sister began to cry. “Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really . . . he needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>number four’s drive. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want —” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. “No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer. . . . Yes, that’s best . . . we won’t do anything. . . .” “But —” “I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watching the house? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted. “Let me see it!” demanded Dudley. “OUT! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. “Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Two more presents. Is that all right?” Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty . . . thirty . . .” “Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia. “Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right then. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed and then said, ‘Yes – yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?’ She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. – <em>J.K.

Harry saw his scared white face look down – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself . . . maybe he didn’t have any friends at Hogwarts. . . . Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face. It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him. “Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!” Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. “Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!” As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>motorbike fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. ‘Hagrid,’ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ‘At last. And where did you get that motorbike?’ ‘Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,’ said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorbike as he spoke. ‘Young Sirius Black lent it me. I’ve got him, sir.’ ‘No problems, were there?’ ‘No, sir – house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>We’ll have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>What about what’s-her-name, your – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon. – <em>J.K.

Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>strangers – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>No es bueno dejarse arrastrar por los sueños y olvidarse de vivir, recuerda eso. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>purple cloak which swept the ground and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realise he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, ‘I should have known.’ He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air and clicked – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You're a wizard Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mum?’ he whispered. ‘Dad?’ They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees – Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. “Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a wizard. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, ‘We got Potter! We got Potter! – <em>J.K.

Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>There are more important things — friendship and bravery – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices!

Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter. – <em>J.K.

The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?” Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . . whatever we want . . . – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You!’ gasped Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter!

The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come you haven’t got any cards? Haven’t you even got friends at that freak place?” “Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,” said Harry coolly. Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom. “Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said suspiciously. “I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,” said Harry. Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face. “You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic — he said he’ll chuck you out of the house — and you haven’t got anywhere – <em>J.K.

До них і близько не могли дорівнятися ті жалюгідні трубочки з тонкого паперу, які зазвичай купували Дурслі. Гаррі разом з Фредом потягли за нитку чарівної хлопавки, й вона не просто вистрелила, а гахнула, наче гармата, оповивши їх хмарою синього диму, і з неї вилетів адміральський капелюх і кілька живих білих мишок.

Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. “I’m a what?” gasped Harry. “A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be?

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!” Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. “Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it! – <em>J.K.

Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. “Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR! – <em>J.K.

I’ve been asking around and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best, I hear Dumbledore himself was one, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad … Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.’ And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. ‘Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,’ said Ron.

Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He looked so dangerous with half his mustache – <em>J.K.

He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>As though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be.

Rowling</em></li><li>And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” “Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>though he wasn’t there – or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug. ‘What about what’s-her-name, your friend – Yvonne?’ ‘On holiday in Majorca,’ snapped Aunt Petunia. ‘You could just leave me here,’ Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon. ‘And come back and find the house in ruins?’ she snarled. ‘I won’t blow up the house,’ said Harry, but they weren’t listening. ‘I suppose we could take him to the zoo,’ said Aunt Petunia slowly, ‘… and leave him in the car …’ ‘That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone …’ Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying, it had been years since he’d really cried, but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>All right, thirty-seven then,’ said Dudley, going red in the face.

He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. – <em>J.K.

It was on his way back past them, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Must pay most dearly in their turn. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>movimientos de los planetas. Tres veces por semana iban a los invernaderos de detrás del castillo a estudiar Herbología, con una bruja pequeña y regordeta llamada profesora Sprout, y aprendían a cuidar de todas las plantas extrañas y hongos y a descubrir para qué debían utilizarlos. Pero la asignatura más aburrida era Historia de la Magia, la única clase dictada por un fantasma. El profesor Binns ya era muy viejo cuando se quedó dormido frente a la chimenea del cuarto de profesores y se levantó a la mañana siguiente para dar clase, dejando atrás su cuerpo. Binns hablaba monótonamente, mientras escribía nombres y fechas, y confundía Emerico el Malvado con Ulrico el Chiflado. El profesor Flitwick, el de la clase de Encantamientos, era un brujo diminuto que tenía que subirse a unos cuantos libros para ver por encima de su escritorio. Al comenzar la  clase sacó la lista y, cuando llegó al nombre – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Je pourrais vous apprendre à mettre la gloire en bouteille, à distiller la grandeur, et même à enfermer la mort dans un flacon si vous étiez autre chose qu’une de ces bandes de cornichons à qui je dispense habituellement mes cours. Cette entrée en matière fut suivie d’un long silence. Harry et Ron échangèrent un regard en levant les sourcils. Hermione Granger était assise tout au bord de sa chaise et avait visiblement hâte de prouver qu’elle n’avait rien d’un cornichon. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ici, on ne s’amuse pas à agiter des baguettes magiques, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ses yeux étaient aussi noirs que ceux de Hagrid mais ils n’avaient pas la même chaleur.

Rowling</em></li><li>Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. “Did you see his face, the great lump?” The other Slytherins joined in. “Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. “Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.” The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. – <em>J.K.

Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. “Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. “Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. “You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the air. “I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. Snape’s lips curled into a sneer. “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” He ignored Hermione’s hand. “Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. “I don’t know, sir. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Vernon – <em>J.K.

Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do. – <em>J.K.

They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.

Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me . . . things I want to know the truth about. . . .” “The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.

He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley thought this was very funny. ‘They stuff people’s heads down the toilet first day at Stonewall,’ he told Harry. ‘Want to come upstairs and practise?’ ‘No thanks,’ said Harry. ‘The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it – it might be sick.’ Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said. – <em>J.K.

The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him. “Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —” “Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.” “Then who does? Sir, I —” “Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.” Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>My brain surprises even me sometimes. . . . – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keepers guard the goalboard; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” “But I —” “HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. “I just —” “I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. “Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and began to drink its blood. “AAAAAAAAAAARGH!” Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t move for fear. Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. “Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply. “We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hermione did a sort of jig. “Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.” “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. . . . – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.” “Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. “His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page. “There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself. “’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.

When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door. ‘Fred? George? Are you there?’ ‘Coming, Mum.’ With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half-hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. ‘Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.’ The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. ‘Mum – geroff.’ He wriggled free. ‘Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?’ said one of the twins. ‘Shut up,’ said Ron. ‘Where’s Percy?’ said their mother. ‘He’s coming now.’ The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. ‘Can’t stay long, Mother,’ he said. ‘I’m up front, the Prefects have got two compartments to themselves –’ ‘Oh, are you a Prefect, Percy?’ said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. ‘You should have said something, we had no idea. – <em>J.K.

When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. “That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. – <em>J.K.

Harry caught a glimpse of her face – and was startled to see that she was in tears. ‘I think she heard you.’ ‘So?’ said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. ‘She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.’ Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Hallowe’en feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ toilets and wanted to be left alone.

Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?” The giant chuckled. “True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm. “What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.” His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath. – <em>J.K.

Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. ‘How did you know it was me?’ she asked. ‘My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.’ ‘You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,’ said Professor McGonagall. ‘All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.’ Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. ‘Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,’ she said impatiently. ‘You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no – even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.’ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. ‘I heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting stars … Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent – I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.’ ‘You can’t blame them,’ said Dumbledore gently. ‘We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.’ ‘I know that,’ said Professor McGonagall irritably. ‘But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumours.’ She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on: ‘A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive. He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the ground and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realise he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, ‘I should have known.’ He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street towards number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Well, I just thought … maybe … it was something to do with … you know … her lot.’ Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name ‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, ‘Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?’ ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffly. ‘What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’ ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ‘Yes, I quite agree.’ He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it was waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did … if it got out that they were related to a pair of – well, he didn’t think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind … He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on. He yawned and turned over. It couldn’t affect them … How very wrong he was. Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learnt a new word (‘Shan’t!’). Mr Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living-room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: ‘And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.’ The news reader allowed himself a grin. ‘Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?’ ‘Well, Ted,’ said the weatherman, ‘I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early – it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.’ Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters … Mrs Dursley came into the living-room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?’ As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister. ‘No,’ she said sharply. ‘Why?’ ‘Funny stuff on the news,’ Mr Dursley mumbled. ‘Owls … shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today …’ ‘So?’ snapped Mrs Dursley. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’ chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get-ups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But – <em>J.K.

До них і близько не могли дорівнятися ті жалюгідні трубочки з тонкого паперу, які зазвичай купували Дурслі. Гаррі разом з Фредом потягли за нитку чарівної хлопавки, й вона не просто вистрелила, а гахнула, наче гармата, оповивши їх хмарою синього диму, і з неї вилетів адміральський капелюх і кілька живих білих мишок.

He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was.

He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.

Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” “But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?” “They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face. “To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day.

That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor. – <em>J.K.

One of his eyes was twitching. ‘Professor Quirrell!’ said Hagrid. ‘Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.’ ‘P-P-Potter,’ stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, ‘c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.’ ‘What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?’ ‘D-Defence Against the D-D-Dark Arts,’ muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. ‘N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?’ He laughed nervously. ‘You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.’ He looked terrified at the very thought. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head. ‘NEVER –’ he thundered, ‘– INSULT – ALBUS – DUMBLEDORE – IN – FRONT – OF – ME! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before – and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life – a high, cold, cruel laugh. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went … bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was …’ Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. ‘Could you write it down?’ Harry suggested. ‘Nah – can’t spell it. All right – Voldemort.’ Hagrid shuddered. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>STOP! I FORBID YOU!’ yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. ‘Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,’ said Hagrid. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. ‘DURSLEY!’ he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like ‘Mimblewimble’. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, ‘About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.’ ‘What world? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. ‘Shhh!’ hissed Professor McGonagall. ‘You’ll wake the Muggles!’ ‘S-s-sorry,’ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. ‘But I c-c-can’t stand it – Lily an’ James dead – an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles –’ ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,’ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I would trust Hagrid with my life,’ said Dumbledore. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>to stop him … but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Lived Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I — I didn’t see you, sir.” “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look — – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Your mother died to save you.

Not a scar, no visible sign . . . to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hurry up!’ their mother said, and the three boys clambered on to the train. They leant out of the window for her to kiss them goodbye and their younger sister began to cry. ‘Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.’ ‘We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.’ ‘George!’ ‘Only joking, Mum. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Harry – yer a wizard.’ There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. ‘I’m a what?’ gasped Harry. ‘A wizard, o’ course, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the dustbin. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Nearly,’ said Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?’ ‘Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.’ ‘Oh, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>P-P-Potter, – <em>J.K.

Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!” This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>o’clock, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had. “Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. ‘All yours,’ smiled Hagrid. All Harry’s – it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. ‘The gold ones are Galleons,’ he explained. ‘Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.’ He turned to Griphook. ‘Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?’ ‘One speed only,’ said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine and Harry leant over the side to try and see what was down at the dark bottom but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downwards and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks towards them. They climbed in – Hagrid with some difficulty – and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering. Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late – they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. ‘I never know,’ Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, ‘what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?’ ‘Stalagmite’s got an “m” in it,’ said Hagrid. ‘An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.’ He did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees trembling. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. ‘Got it,’ said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. ‘That seems to be in order.’ ‘An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,’ said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. ‘It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.’ The goblin read the letter carefully. ‘Very well,’ he said, handing it back to Hagrid, ‘I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!’ Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog-biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook towards one of the doors leading off the hall. ‘What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?’ Harry asked. ‘Can’t tell yeh that,’ said Hagrid mysteriously. ‘Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>his throat nervously. ‘Er – Petunia, dear – you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?’ As he had expected, Mrs Dursley – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>imagination. As he pulled into – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar—a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen—then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive—no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. MrDursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>E' strano quanto essere invisibile possa renderti miope!" osservò Silente. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Signore...professor Silente... Posso farle una domanda?"[...]"Lei che cosa vede, quando si guarda nello Specchio?""Io? Mi vedo con in mano un paio di grossi calzini di lana."Harry lo guardò incredulo."I calzini non bastano ma" disse Silente. "E' passato un altro Natale e nessuno mi ha regalato un solo paio di calzini. Chissà perché a me regalano soltanto libri. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>[...] Ma il guaio è che le persone hanno una particolare abilità nello scegliere proprio le cose peggiori per loro. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>All right, keep your hair on. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. “I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.” Hagrid dropped the teapot. “How do you know about Fluffy?” he said. “Fluffy?” “Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the — – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>سؤالًا – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>She pulled the door wide. The Entrance Hall was so big you could have fitted the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?” He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>more – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or —” “Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” “Great idea though, thanks, Mum. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had got the new computer he wanted, not to mention – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Le courage peut prendre de nombreuses formes, dit-il avec un sourire. Il faut beaucoup de bravoure pour faire face à ses ennemis mais il n’en faut pas moins pour affronter ses amis. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Abbott, Hannah! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. “Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,’ said Ron impressively. ‘And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Philosopher’s St–’ ‘Shhhh!’ Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. ‘Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?’ ‘There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,’ said Harry, ‘about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy –’ ‘SHHHH!’ said Hagrid again. ‘Listen – come an’ see me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh –’ ‘See you later, then,’ said Harry. Hagrid shuffled off. ‘What was he hiding behind his back?’ said Hermione thoughtfully. ‘Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?’ ‘I’m going to see what section he was in,’ said Ron, who’d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. ‘Dragons!’ he whispered. ‘Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.’ ‘Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,’ said Harry. ‘But it’s against our laws,’ said Ron. ‘Dragon-breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>horrible. Hope you’re well. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Bien hecho —dijo éste en voz baja, para que sólo Harry lo oyera—. Es agradable comprobar que no has estado inquieto por ese espejo... que te has mantenido ocupado... excelente... Snape escupió con amargura en el suelo. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry escondió rápidamente la capa. No se sentía con ganas de compartirla con nadie más. – <em>J.K.

Decía «Potter, presidente» y Dean, que dibujaba bien, había trazado un gran león de Gryffindor. – <em>J.K.

Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street towards number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the Wizarding world. Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.” Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. “If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. “He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy. – <em>J.K.

It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar.Harry : And who owned that wand?Mr. Ollivander : We do not speak his name! The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible!

If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.

Rowling</em></li><li>Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they had sat down in her first class. ‘Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,’ she said. ‘Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot.

Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall Deputy Headmistress – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all – the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things which are worst for them. – <em>J.K.

He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Professor McGonagall – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Il n’arrivait pas à y croire. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?’ It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. ‘Library books are not to be taken outside the school,’ said Snape. ‘Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.’ ‘He’s just made that rule up,’ Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. ‘Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?’ ‘Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,’ said Ron bitterly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Another Weasley, eh?’ said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. ‘I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the Forest. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>not in the same league – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living-room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-coloured bobble hats – but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large, blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a roundabout at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name ‘Potter’. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, ‘Their son – he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?’ ‘I suppose so,’ said Mrs Dursley stiffly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You said You-Know-Who’s name!’ said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. ‘I’d have thought you, of all people – – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Caput Draconis, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Now, you two – this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve – you’ve blown up a toilet or –’ ‘Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.’ ‘Great idea though, thanks, Mum.’ ‘It’s not funny. And look after Ron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry suddenly realised that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. – <em>J.K.

A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>people in town today . . .” “So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. “Well, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do with . . . you know – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>motorcycle – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry — yer a wizard.” There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. “I’m a what?” gasped Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>camino de los que llegaban tarde a clase. También les lanzaba papeleras a la cabeza, tiraba de las alfombras debajo de los pies del que pasaba, les arrojaba tizas o, invisible, se deslizaba – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid!’ said Harry. ‘That Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first-years never getting in the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories which always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a hang-glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about football. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham football team, trying to make the players move. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticising almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class were standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>his – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.” “Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t play,” said Hermione at once. “Say you’re ill,” said Ron. “Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested. “Really break your leg,” said Ron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. “Don’t play,” said Hermione at once. “Say you’re ill,” said Ron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>se escribe. Está bien... Voldemort. —Hagrid se estremeció—. No me lo hagas repetir. De todos modos, este... este mago, hace unos veinte años, comenzó a buscar seguidores. Y los consiguió; algunos le tenían miedo, otros sólo querían un poco de su poder, porque él iba consiguiendo – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>su ferocidad durante la noche. Harry no podía dormir. Se estremecía y daba vueltas, tratando de ponerse cómodo, con el estómago rugiendo de hambre. Los ronquidos de Dudley quedaron amortiguados por los truenos que estallaron cerca de la medianoche. El reloj luminoso de – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Will you stop saying the name! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly. “Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me one more thing, however.” “What do you see when you look in the mirror?” “I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” Harry stared. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Il n’en existe pas beaucoup et c’est vraiment précieux… – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Or both,’ said Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry learnt that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practising the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd got the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big bins outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Comb your hair!’ he barked, by way of a morning greeting. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>In the car crash when your parents died,’ she had said. ‘And don’t ask questions.’ Don’t ask questions – that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dudley’s favourite punch-bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice which made the first noise of the day. ‘Up! Get up! Now!’ Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. ‘Up!’ she screeched. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large, blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a roundabout at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>mark. Not a scar, no visible sign . . . to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Creo que debemos esperar grandes cosas de ti, Harry Potter... Después de todo. El-que-no-debe-ser-nombrado hizo grandes cosas... Terribles, sí, pero grandiosas. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dumbledore, however, was choosing another sherbet lemon and did not answer. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two sherbet lemons, seemed not to notice. ‘It – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!’ said Ron. ‘He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word . . .” In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>But it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. “Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.” Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. “Are you serious, Professor?” “Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?” Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. “He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel – Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. – <em>J.K.

Percy could be heard telling the other Prefects, ‘My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess set!’ At last there was silence again. ‘Second – to Miss Hermione Granger … for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.’ Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears.

Look in the pockets.” Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. “Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily. “Knuts? – <em>J.K.

Dudley jerked awake. “Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>just – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.” Hagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. “Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that...let’s see...he borrowed Fluffy from me...then some o’ the teachers did enchantments...Professor Sprout—Professor Flitwick—Professor McGonagall—” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell—an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.” “Snape?” “Yeah—yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.” Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything—except, it – <em>J.K.

The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. – <em>J.K.

You’ll be expelled!” “SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup?

Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, "My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!"At last there was silence again."Second- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points."Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves- they were a hundred points up."Third- to Mr. Harry Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. "... for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points."The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent."There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom."Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him."Which means," Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, "we need a little change of decoration."He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once."Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner."Bleaaargh- see? Sprouts?"They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again."Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him."Er- yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.""So you must know loads of magic already."The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about."I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are they like?""Horrible- well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.""Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat."Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep."His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I wonder, now- yes, why not- unusual combination- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious..."He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, "Curious... curious...""Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?"Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare."I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother- why, its brother gave you that scar."Harry swallowed."Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things- terrible, yes, but great. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons- All Sizes- Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver- Self-Stirring- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them."Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money first."Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad...."A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. "Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus Two Thousand- fastest ever-" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.... – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.It winked.Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:"I get that all the time.""I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying."The snake nodded vigorously."Where do you come from, anyway?" Harry asked.The snake jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see- so you've never been to Brazil?"As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. "DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!"Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could."Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.Harry had sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come... Thanksss, amigo. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I'm warning you now, boy- any funny business, anything at all- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.""I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly..."But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received an angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I've got him, sir.""No problems, were there?""No, sir- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol."Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.

He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it."In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask questions."Don't ask questions- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. – <em>J.K.

Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? “If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.

Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the air. “I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. Snape’s lips curled into a sneer. “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” He ignored Hermione’s hand. “Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. “I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand. “What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. “I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her? – <em>J.K.

He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. “There he is, Mum, there he is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron. “Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mum!

True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all.

She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?” “Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.” Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?” As – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.

Ron looked taken aback. ‘Er – all right.’ He cleared his throat. ‘Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.’ He waved his wand, but nothing happened.

Rowling</em></li><li>Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colours. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he’d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. “What are you looking for, boy?” “Nothing,” said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. “You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!” Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to. Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. “You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.” “And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.” “Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione. Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work. Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn’t – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. “The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?” “One speed only,” said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. – <em>J.K.

They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref! Red card!” “What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron. “Red card!” said Dean furiously. “This isn’t football, Dean,” Ron reminded him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>pigtails stumbled out of line, put on – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>À huit heures et demie, Mr Dursley prit son attaché-case, déposa un baiser sur la joue de Mrs Dursley et essaya d’embrasser Dudley, mais sans succès, car celui-ci était en proie à une petite crise de colère et s’appliquait à jeter contre les murs de la pièce le contenu de son assiette de céréales. – Sacré petit bonhomme, – <em>J.K.

Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and Harry – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Sir – Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?’ ‘Obviously, you’ve just done so,’ Dumbledore smiled. ‘You may ask me one more thing, however.’ ‘What do you see when you look in the Mirror?’ ‘I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woollen socks.’ Harry stared. ‘One can never have enough socks, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Professor Quirrell, who was passing.

Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. “Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor – <em>J.K.

Mr Dursley – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr et Mrs Dursley, qui habitaient au 4, Privet Drive, avaient toujours affirmé avec la plus grande fierté qu’ils étaient parfaitement normaux, merci pour eux. Jamais quiconque n’aurait imaginé qu’ils puissent se trouver impliqués dans quoi que ce soit d’étrange ou de mystérieux. Ils n’avaient pas de temps à perdre avec des sornettes. Mr Dursley dirigeait la Grunnings, une entreprise qui fabriquait des perceuses. C’était un homme grand et massif, qui n’avait pratiquement pas de cou, mais possédait en revanche une moustache de belle taille. Mrs Dursley, quant à elle, était mince et blonde et disposait d’un cou deux fois plus long que la moyenne, ce qui lui était fort utile pour espionner ses voisins en regardant par-dessus les clôtures des jardins. Les Dursley avaient un petit garçon prénommé Dudley et c’était à leurs yeux le plus bel enfant du monde. Les Dursley avaient tout ce qu’ils voulaient. La seule chose indésirable qu’ils possédaient, c’était – <em>J.K.

Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Noem dingen altijd bij hun naam. De angst voor een naam vergroot je angst voor het ding op zich. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Tokens from your friends and admirers, said Dumbledore, beaming. What happened down in the dungeons between you an Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygenic, and confiscated it. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Oy, pea-brain! yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>algunos de los mejores magos y brujas de su tiempo – <em>J.K.

It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. “But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date. “Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!” There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Griphook: "If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there."Harry Potter: "How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?"Griphook: "About once every ten years. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dumbledore thinks that – what was it? – “to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure”. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside – and a horrible scene met his eyes. Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day! – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling. “How touching . . .” it hissed. “I always value bravery. . . . Yes, boy, your parents were brave. . . . I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. “Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have his key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. “Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He-who-must-not-be-named did great things, terrible, yes. But great. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious. “I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. “Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it. . . .” He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows —” “Who?” “Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.” “Why not?” “Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .” Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. “Could you write it down? – <em>J.K.

Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. “Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!” She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mummy will never forget you! – <em>J.K.

No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s gone. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>How did you know it was me?” she asked. “My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared. “He’s gone!” “Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favourite sport: Harry- hunting. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good- for- nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. – <em>J.K.

D’accord… L’oncle Vernon se rassit en soufflant comme un rhinocéros prêt à charger et surveilla attentivement Harry du coin de ses petits yeux perçants. Depuis qu’il était revenu à la maison pour les vacances d’été, l’oncle Vernon l’avait traité comme une bombe sur le point d’exploser. Harry, en effet, n’était pas un garçon normal. Pour tout dire, il était même difficile d’être aussi peu normal que lui. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry sortit par la porte de derrière. Le ciel était clair, le soleil éblouissant.

At the start of their first lesson he took the register, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they had sat down in her first class. ‘Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,’ she said. ‘Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.’ Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realised they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After making a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, – <em>J.K.

Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl. Heart – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Chame-o de Voldemort. Sempre chame as coisas pelo nome que têm. O medo de um nome aumenta o medo da coisa em si. – – <em>J.K.

Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red-and-gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. “Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves —” “Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.” “Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the other twin. “Once —” “Or twice —” “A minute —” “All summer —” “Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. – <em>J.K.

Una manina si richiuse sulla lettera che aveva accanto e lui continuò a dormire, senza sapere che era speciale, senza sapere che era famoso, senza sapere che di lì a qualche ora sarebbe stato svegliato dall'urlo della signora Dursley che apriva la porta di casa per mettere fuori le bottiglie del latte, né che le settimane successive le avrebbe trascorse a farsi riempire di spintoni e pizzicotti dal cugino Dudley... Non poteva sapere che, in quello stesso istante, da un capo all'altro del paese, c'era gente che si riuniva in segreto e levava i calici per brindare «a Harry Potter, il bambino che è sopravvissuto». – <em>J.K.Rowling</em></li><li>Es verlangt einiges an Mut, sich seinen Feinden entgegenzustellen, doch genauso viel, den eigenen Freunden in den Weg zu treten. – <em>J.K.

Bit of a nasty shock for him.” The others laughed. “What about you, Neville?” said Ron. “Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight.

It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. “The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —” “— yes, their son, Harry —” Mr. – <em>J.K.

Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. “All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. “Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch?” A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed — WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. “Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors. Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goalposts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. Down – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. – <em>J.K.

All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. As – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch. They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. “Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. “Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again. “What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.” Hermione – <em>J.K.

Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. “But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Si tu entamais ces friandises ? Ah, les Dragées surprises de Bertie Crochue ! Un jour, quand j’étais jeune, j’en ai trouvé une qui avait le goût de vomi. Depuis, j’ai peur d’en manger, mais toi, ne t’en prive surtout pas ! Enfin, je pense que je ne risque rien avec un caramel. Il sourit et mit la dragée d’un brun doré dans sa bouche. Puis il se mit à tousser. – Quelle horreur ! De la cire pour les oreilles ! – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Lorsqu’il essaya de l’expliquer à Hermione, celle-ci répondit : – Ce sont les examens qui font ça. La nuit dernière, je me suis réveillée et je me suis mise à relire la moitié de mes notes de métamorphose avant de me souvenir qu’on avait déjà passé l’examen. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hermione se leva d’un bond, l’air aussi surexcité que le jour où on leur avait rendu leurs premiers devoirs. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Harry avait notamment appris qu’il existait sept cents fautes possibles au Quidditch et qu’elles avaient toutes été commises au cours d’un match de la Coupe du Monde en 1473. Que les attrapeurs étaient généralement les joueurs les plus petits et les plus rapides et qu’ils étaient exposés aux accidents les plus graves. Que des arbitres avaient parfois disparu pour réapparaître des mois plus tard dans le désert du Sahara et qu’enfin on mourait rarement au cours des matches de Quidditch. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>À compter de ce moment, Hermione devint amie avec Ron et Harry. Il se crée des liens particuliers lorsqu’on fait ensemble certaines choses. Abattre un troll de quatre mètres de haut, par exemple. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Dieu sait que nous avons besoin d’une meilleure équipe que celle de l’année dernière. Nous avons été littéralement écrasés par les Serpentard. Pendant des semaines, je n’ai plus osé regarder Severus Rogue en face… – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>J’espère que vous êtes contents de vous. On aurait pu se faire tuer, ou pire, être renvoyés. Et maintenant, si ça ne vous dérange pas, je vais me coucher. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Snape didn’t dislike Harry – he hated him. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. “Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it with sneaking around and spying. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Excuse me.” They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. “Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>El señor y la señora Dursley, que vivían en el número 4 de Privet Drive, estaban orgullosos de decir que eran muy normales, afortunadamente. Eran las últimas personas que se esperaría encontrar relacionadas con algo extraño o misterioso, porque no estaban para tales tonterías. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules? – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Make Harry get it.” “Get the mail, Harry.” “Make Dudley get it.” “Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. “Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Racionaliam protui mirtis tėra dar vienas didelis nuotykis. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Mr och mrs Dursley i nummer fyra på Privet Drive var med rätta stolta över att kunna säga att de var helt normala. De var de sista man kunde tänka sig inblandade i något konstigt eller mystiskt, för de godtog verkligen inga sådana dumheter. – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the Forest. ‘Look there,’ said Hagrid, ‘see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.’ ‘And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?’ said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. ‘There’s nothin’ that lives in the Forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,’ said Hagrid. ‘An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.’ ‘I want Fang,’ said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth. ‘All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,’ said Hagrid. ‘So me, Harry an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an’ practise now – that’s it – an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh – so, be careful – let’s go.’ The Forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and Harry, Hermione and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville and Fang took the right. They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves. Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. ‘Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?’ Harry asked. ‘Not fast enough,’ said Hagrid. ‘It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.’ They walked past a mossy tree-stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still – <em>J.K.

Rowling</em></li><li>Harry stood up. ‘Sir – Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?’ ‘Obviously, you’ve just done so,’ Dumbledore smiled. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li><li>Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning."Is that where-?" whispered Professor McGonagall."Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever. – <em>J.K. Rowling</em></li></ul></body></html>
